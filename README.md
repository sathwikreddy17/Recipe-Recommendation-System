# IR-Project----Recipe_Recommendation_By_User_Cluster
This is a project for a class where we used KMeans and KNN clustering in two different ways to provide recommended recipes to users. Efficacy of recommendations has not been tested.

The dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions

Candidate recipe ipynb is a method of filtering recipes by the user inputted ingredient list. Another method is utilized in the main code, but this file may be of interest for future works.
